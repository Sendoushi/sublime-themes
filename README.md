Sublime Themes
==============

I loved the basic Monokai theme from Sublime, which by the way is awesome, but there were some colors that I would prefer to be different.

Just made some adjustments and now I'm publishing for all those that want to use it.

Here is a screenshot of it:

To install, for the Mac users, go to the terminal and:

**1st step** - `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/`

**2nd step** - `git clone https://github.com/Sendoushi/sublime-themes custom-themes`

**3rd step** - Open Sublime Text

**4th step** - Select on the menu Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Color Scheme > custom-themes > sendoushi-monokai

This installation process is for **Sublime Text 2**, haven't tried it on the 3 yet.

You may also just download, go manually to the **Packages** folder and get the sendoushi-monokai file inside.

I have it plural because maybe in the future I'll make some changes to others.
