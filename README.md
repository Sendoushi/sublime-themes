Sublime Themes
==============

I love the basic Monokai theme from Sublime but there were some colors that I would prefer to be different.

Just made some adjustments and now I'm publishing for all those that want to use it.

To install, for the Mac users, go to the terminal and:

**1st step** - `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/`


**2nd step** - `git clone https://github.com/Sendoushi/sublime-themes custom-themes`

**3rd step** - Open Sublime Text

**4th step** - Select on the menu Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Color Scheme > custom-themes > sendoushi-monokai

This installation process is for **Sublime Text 2** and doesn't work in Sublime Text 3, it has a different way to do themes. 

You may also just download, go manually to the **Packages** folder and get the sendoushi-monokai file inside.

I have it plural because maybe in the future I'll make some changes to others.
